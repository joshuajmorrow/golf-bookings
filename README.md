# golf-bookings

As a golfer, I want to see which public and semi-public tee times are best for me to book in a given time frame so I can book tee times for myself and others without checking multiple places and automating subsequent follow-ups

AC:
1. wish list
2. directions from a given address
3. alarm for when to leave
4. value score based on cost/distance/course ratings
5. estimated completion time based on pace of play
6. invite friends to book with me
7. link to booking websites
8. notifications when tee times become available
9. course difficulty rating based on rating and slope
